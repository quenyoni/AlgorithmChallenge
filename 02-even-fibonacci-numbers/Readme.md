# Challenge #2 - Even Fibonacci Numbers 

This is a practice challenge from https://projecteuler.net/problem=2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with and , the first terms will be: 1 and 2.

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Instructions

Write a function called `evenFibs` that takes in a limit number `limit` and returns the total of the even '.

### Function Signature

```js
/**
 * Returns a number that is the total of multiples of 3 and 5'.
 * @returns {number} 
 */
function evenFibs(limit:number): number;
```



### Constraints

I will put any constraints here. They will vary depending on the challenge.

- The function must return an integer

```JS
function evenFibs(limit) {
	const fibList = [1, 2];

	//current num = positionLast + positionLast-1;

	while (true) {
		const currentNum =
			fibList[fibList.length - 1] +
			fibList[fibList.length - 2];

		//condition that will negate the while loop
		if (currentNum > limit) {
			break;
		}

		fibList.push(currentNum);
	}

	return fibList.reduce((sum, num) => {
		return (sum = num % 2 == 0 ? sum + num : sum);
	}, 0);
}
```
